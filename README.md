BBQ
===

A Rails practice app.

This app is supposed to help people organize barbecues
but it's got a few problems.


Task #1: Authentication
-----------------------

As it is now, anyone who visits the site can create a new barbecue.
We would like visitors to have to register before they can access the site.

### The Task ###

1. Add authentication to the app with
[devise](http://devise.plataformatec.com.br) or the method of your choice.
2. Prevent anonymous users from accessing the routes of `BarbecuesController`.
3. Add a small user profile header section
with the user's name, email and a log out button.


Task #2: Fix the Barbecue page
------------------------------


Task #3: Allow users to join a BBQ
----------------------------------
